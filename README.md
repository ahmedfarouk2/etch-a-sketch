# etch-a-sketch

As simple as the title implies, we'll be making a a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch, Just load up the HTML and you're good to go. Part of TOP curriculum.

Worth mentioning that for the moment this won't work on mobile as it's not been teached in the curriculum yet.

Thanks!
